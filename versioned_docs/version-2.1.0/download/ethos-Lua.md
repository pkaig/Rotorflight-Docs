# Download - Ethos Tx Lua

Lua script **must match** the current firmware version loaded into your Flight Controller. If you update firmware you must also update the Lua scripts to match.

## Versions

There are two different Lua scripts available for Ethos radios. Either version can be used. First version is text based. The second is the RF touch version. Choose whichever you prefer.
