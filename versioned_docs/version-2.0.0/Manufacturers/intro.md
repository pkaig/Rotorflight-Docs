# Manufacturers Information  
The Rotorflight team have collaborated with several manufacturers to produce Flight Controllers for use with our software. We welcome working with other vendors and designers. Please contact us on admin@rotorflight.org or on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7S2Emh9TsR) and we can discuss further.  

## Flight Controller Specifications
We have documented some flight controller [Design Requirements](Design-Requirements.md). Also there are several pin and MCU specific [Reference Designs](Reference-Design.md). These are specified to optimise resources and provide a consistent starting point. 

:::caution note
For an FC to be fully supported by Rotorflight-2 (RF2), it must follow one of the Reference Designs.

## Support
Rotorflight can provide a testing team for your design. Both from the electrical side interfacing to different receivers and ESCs as well as flight testing by great pilots.
