# Design Requirements

This page collects the generic hardware requirements for all Flight Controller designs for Rotorflight.

The actual Reference Designs for Rotorflight-2 can be found [here](./Reference-Design.md).

__For an FC to be fully supported by Rotorflight-2 (RF2), it must follow one of the Reference Designs.__


## Betaflight Guidlines

Rotorflight is based on Betaflight, and thus has the same basic requirements for the hardware.

Please read the Design Guidelines for [Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/4.4.0-RC5/docs/Manufacturer%20Design%20Guidelines.md)
first.
