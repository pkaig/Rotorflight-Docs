A good starting point is to use a single with Q = 2.5 on the fundamental and a double with Q = 2.5 on the second harmonic for the main rotor. For tail rotor, a single with Q = 2.5 on fundamental and second harmonic will most likely do the job. Motor filter should be turned on as well for non-direct drive machines. A first-order Gyro low pass filter with cutoff frequency of 100hz should be turned on. Notice: a low Q value makes the filter wide and strong, a high Q value makes the filter narrow and weak.
