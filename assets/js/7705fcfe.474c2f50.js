However, there could be another scenario that a constant cross-coupling might occur. If the main blade flap axis is not centered at the middle commonly due to very hard dampeners, very low headspeed, or rotorhead designs, a constant cross coupling might occur because the phase lag of the rotor blade is no longer perfectly 90deg. In this case, you might want to consider adjusting the phase angle in the Mixer page. Usually a +2 to +10 deg would be a good range to start and more testing is needed. You might also want to make sure that it is doing the right thing. For CW rotor, when pushing the elevator, the swash should tilt slightly right, and when you pull the elevator stick, the swash should tilt slightly left."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},28453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>a});var n=o(96540);const i={},s=n.createContext(i);function r(e){const t=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:r(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
