A good filter tuning should be just strong enough to suppress the peaks in the gyro readouts. A filter too weak may have peaks leaked inside the loop, and a filter too strong, while making the gyro signal clean, may lower the maximum gains later which cause a \\"sloppy\\" and delayed feel.","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/High Speed Integral":{"id":"Tuning/High Speed Integral","title":"High Speed Integral","description":"Page 1","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Motorised Tail and TTA":{"id":"Tuning/Motorised Tail and TTA","title":"Motorised Tail and TTA","description":"Torque Tail Assist (TTA) - This is a feature used for helicopters with motorised tails. A motorised tail can provide high control authority in one direction. In the other it is greatly reduced as the motor can only turn in one direction. TTA is ised to add control authority in the other direction. It does this by rapidly accelerating the main motor. This acceleration provides torque in the oposite direction to the tail motor.","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Rescue mode settings":{"id":"Tuning/Rescue mode settings","title":"Rescue mode settings","description":"","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Tune Cyclic":{"id":"Tuning/Tune Cyclic","title":"Tune Cyclic","description":"Page 1","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Tune Feedforward":{"id":"Tuning/Tune Feedforward","title":"Tune Feedforward","description":"Page 1","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Tune the Tail":{"id":"Tuning/Tune the Tail","title":"Tune the Tail","description":"Page 1","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Tuning-description":{"id":"Tuning/Tuning-description","title":"Tuning Guide for 0602 version controller (Gyro D)","description":"This guide assumes no super low frequency (< 60Hz) global LPF","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tutorial - Quickstart/Converting from RF1 to RF2":{"id":"Tutorial - Quickstart/Converting from RF1 to RF2","title":"Converting from RF1 to RF2","description":"It is really important that a Rotorflight 1 backup/dump file is not loaded to the Rotorflight 2 controller.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tutorial - Quickstart/Introduction":{"id":"Tutorial - Quickstart/Introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Rotorflight is a flight control software suite for single rotor RC helicopters.
