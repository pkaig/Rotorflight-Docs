Unfortunately, drones do not have servos and have more motors than we need for a helicopter. In order to use servos with a Betaflight controller we must remap the pins so we have a pad to connect the servos to.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"setup/rpm-filters":{"id":"setup/rpm-filters","title":"RPM Filters","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"setup/rpm-measurement":{"id":"setup/rpm-measurement","title":"RPM Measurement","description":"In order to use the Governor or RPM filters (and why wouldn\'t you!!) you must measure the RPM.

A good filter tuning should be just strong enough to suppress the peaks in the gyro readouts. A filter too weak may have peaks leaked inside the loop, and a filter too strong, while making the gyro signal clean, may lower the maximum gains later which cause a \\"sloppy\\" and delayed feel.","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/High-Speed-Integral":{"id":"Tuning/High-Speed-Integral","title":"High Speed Integral","description":"TL;DR","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Motorised-Tail-and-TTA":{"id":"Tuning/Motorised-Tail-and-TTA","title":"Motorised Tail and TTA","description":"Torque Tail Assist (TTA) - This is a feature used for helicopters with motorised tails. A motorised tail can provide high control authority in one direction. In the other it is greatly reduced as the motor can only turn in one direction. TTA is used to add control authority in the other direction. It does this by rapidly accelerating the main motor. This acceleration provides torque in the opposite direction to the tail motor.","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Rescue-mode-settings":{"id":"Tuning/Rescue-mode-settings","title":"Rescue mode settings","description":"","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Tune-Feedforward":{"id":"Tuning/Tune-Feedforward","title":"Tune Feedforward","description":"It is a good practice to check for the feed forward tune after adjusting other parameters.
