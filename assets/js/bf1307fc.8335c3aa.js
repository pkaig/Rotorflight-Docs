A good filter tuning should be just strong enough to suppress the peaks in the gyro readouts. A filter too weak may have peaks leaked inside the loop, and a filter too strong, while making the gyro signal clean, may lower the maximum gains later which cause a \\"sloppy\\" and delayed feel.","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/High-Speed-Integral":{"id":"Tuning/High-Speed-Integral","title":"High Speed Integral","description":"TL;DR","sidebar":"tuningSidebar"},"Tuning/Motorised-Tail-and-TTA":{"id":"Tuning/Motorised-Tail-and-TTA","title":"Motorised Tail and TTA","description":"Torque Tail Assist (TTA) - This is a feature used for helicopters with motorised tails. A motorised tail can provide high control authority in one direction. In the other it is greatly reduced as the motor can only turn in one direction. TTA is ised to add control authority in the other direction. It does this by rapidly accelerating the main motor.
