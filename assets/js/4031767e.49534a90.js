The reusable sensors in the GPS frame are altitude, heading, ground speed, and satellite count.\\n\\nThe reuse options are now selected based on the original sensor scaling, so that the reused value can be expressed correctly.\\n\\nFor most reuse options, the \\"ratio\\" in EdgeTx is a variation of 255.\\nE.g. 25.5, 255, 2550, 25500. (including RPM!)\\n\\nThe voltage sensors use 20 or 200.\\n\\n#### OpenYGE ESC Telemetry\\n\\nThere is now telemetry support for YGE ESCs (thanks Bob!). This is a brand new protocol implemented by YGE especially for Rotorflight. It will be available in the next ESC firmware update from YGE.\\n\\n#### Default values in the Firmware\\n\\nMany defaults have been improved. Please note that you won\'t get any new defaults if you load a dump all from the previous snapshot. Probably better to use a diff all, which will apply only the parameter values that are not on default values.\\n\\nNext one will be a Release Candidate, so please report any issues promptly!\\n\\nHappy tuning (and maybe even flying)!"},{"id":"/2024/01/28/snapshot 2.0.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/announcement/2024/01/28/snapshot 2.0.0","source":"@site/announcement/2024-01-28-snapshot 2.0.0.md","title":"snapshot 2.0.0-20240128","description":"Rotorflight snapshot 2.0.0-20240128 is ready","date":"2024-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 28, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":2.51,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Rotorflight","image_url":"https://github.com/rotorflight.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/rotorflight.png"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"snapshot 2.0.0-20240128","authors":{"name":"Rotorflight","image_url":"https://github.com/rotorflight.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/rotorflight.png"}},"prevItem":{"title":"snapshot 2.0.0-20240218","permalink":"/announcement/2024/02/18/snapshot 2.0.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"snapshot 2.0.0-20240105","permalink":"/announcement/2024/01/05/snapshot 2.0.0"}},"content":"Rotorflight snapshot 2.0.0-20240128 is ready\\n\\n If you wish to become involved in testing these snapshots please contact us on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/6QUySXdEvd)\\n\\n:::danger\\nThis snapshot is not suitable for end-users.

Arming is disabled if it is not available.\\n\\n#### Realtime Load\\nThere is a new Load figure on the bottom bar in the Configurator.\\nIt is showing the peak \\"real-time load\\" in the FC.\\nThe realtime load is the percentage of CPU time used in real-time tasks after every gyro sample.\\nIt must stay below 70% or so for the FC to work at all.\\n\\n#### Blackbox logging is the single most CPU intensive task in the FC.\\nOnce enabled, it can easily double the load.\\nPlease check that the FC stays below 70% with logging enabled!\\n\\n#### CRSF Voltage telemetry\\nThere are new options for voltage telemetry in the CRSF reuse.\\nPlease set the ratio in EdgeTx to 20.\\n\\n#### Setpoint Response time\\nThis per-axis parameter replaces the old \\"Setpoint Smoothness\\".\\nIt does exactly the same thing, but now has a physically meaningful value.\\nIt represents the speed the setpoint will converge to the commanded value in ms.\\nIt is important not to set much lower than the heli\'s natural reaction time.\\nThe default is 20ms for cyclic and 15ms for tail. Most helis simply can\'t move faster than this.\\n\\nSetting this too low will cause unnecessary I-term windup and other PID issues.\\n\\nValues higher than the heli\'s reaction time will simply slow it down even more.\\nThis is especially neat for scale flying, or just for the pilots preference.\\n\\n#### CMS\\nCMS is now disabled by default.\\n\\nThere is a Feature flag for enabling it. This will also enable the necessary stick commands - BE AWARE!\\n\\n#### Servo limits\\nServo limits have been extended to 70deg, as requested.\\nAs before, they need to be adjusted if the default value is not suitable for the heli."},{"id":"/2024/01/05/snapshot 2.0.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/announcement/2024/01/05/snapshot 2.0.0","source":"@site/announcement/2024-01-05-snapshot 2.0.0.md","title":"snapshot 2.0.0-20240105","description":"Rotorflight snapshot 2.0.0-20240105 is ready","date":"2024-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 5, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":1.055,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Rotorflight","image_url":"https://github.com/rotorflight.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/rotorflight.png"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"snapshot 2.0.0-20240105","authors":{"name":"Rotorflight","image_url":"https://github.com/rotorflight.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/rotorflight.png"}},"prevItem":{"title":"snapshot 2.0.0-20240128","permalink":"/announcement/2024/01/28/snapshot 2.0.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"snapshot 2.0.0-20231127","permalink":"/announcement/2023/11/27/snapshot 2.0.0"}},"content":"Rotorflight snapshot 2.0.0-20240105 is ready\\n\\n If you wish to become involved in testing these snapshots please contact us on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/6QUySXdEvd)\\n\\n:::danger\\nThis snapshot is not suitable for end-users.
