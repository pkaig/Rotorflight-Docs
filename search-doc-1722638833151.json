Also, the governor mode 2 requires battery voltage. Arming is disabled if it is not available.  Realtime Load​  There is a new Load figure on the bottom bar in the Configurator. It is showing the peak &quot;real-time load&quot; in the FC. The realtime load is the percentage of CPU time used in real-time tasks after every gyro sample. It must stay below 70% or so for the FC to work at all.  Blackbox logging is the single most CPU intensive task in the FC.​  Once enabled, it can easily double the load. Please check that the FC stays below 70% with logging enabled!  CRSF Voltage telemetry​  There are new options for voltage telemetry in the CRSF reuse. Please set the ratio in EdgeTx to 20.  Setpoint Response time​  This per-axis parameter replaces the old &quot;Setpoint Smoothness&quot;. It does exactly the same thing, but now has a physically meaningful value. It represents the speed the setpoint will converge to the commanded value in ms. It is important not to set much lower than the heli's natural reaction time. The default is 20ms for cyclic and 15ms for tail. Most helis simply can't move faster than this.  Setting this too low will cause unnecessary I-term windup and other PID issues.  Values higher than the heli's reaction time will simply slow it down even more. This is especially neat for scale flying, or just for the pilots preference.  CMS​  CMS is now disabled by default.  There is a Feature flag for enabling it. This will also enable the necessary stick commands - BE AWARE!  Servo limits​  Servo limits have been extended to 70deg, as requested. As before, they need to be adjusted if the default value is not suitable for the heli.

The CRSF reuse has now been refactored for better support for different EdgeTx versions.  There are now more sensors that can be reused. The reusable sensors in the GPS frame are altitude, heading, ground speed, and satellite count.  The reuse options are now selected based on the original sensor scaling, so that the reused value can be expressed correctly.  For most reuse options, the &quot;ratio&quot; in EdgeTx is a variation of 255. E.g. 25.5, 255, 2550, 25500. (including RPM!)  The voltage sensors use 20 or 200.  OpenYGE ESC Telemetry​  There is now telemetry support for YGE ESCs (thanks Bob!). This is a brand new protocol implemented by YGE especially for Rotorflight. It will be available in the next ESC firmware update from YGE.  Default values in the Firmware​  Many defaults have been improved. Please note that you won't get any new defaults if you load a dump all from the previous snapshot. Probably better to use a diff all, which will apply only the parameter values that are not on default values.  Next one will be a Release Candidate, so please report any issues promptly!

Another scenario is during hover, one can shake the elevator stick and observe a tilt in the roll axis and a significant drift in the yaw axis. These are both the symptoms of uncompensated cyclic cross coupling.  Cyclic cross coupling happens mainly due to the pitch axis inputs. When the pitch command is given, due to the high moment of inertia of the helicopter in the pitch axis, the frame would &quot;lag&quot; behind the rotor disks. This difference in position creates a torque on the rotor blade and thus transfer to the roll axis due to gyroscopic precession.  The cross coupling compensation simply take a derivative on the pitch SETPOINT and add it proportionally to the roll axis. This effectively pre-load the roll axis with a input command so that when the above scenario happens, the two effects cancel each other.

However, there could be another scenario that a constant cross-coupling might occur. If the main blade flap axis is not centered at the middle commonly due to very hard dampeners, very low headspeed, or rotorhead designs, a constant cross coupling might occur because the phase lag of the rotor blade is no longer perfectly 90deg. In this case, you might want to consider adjusting the phase angle in the Mixer page. Usually a +2 to +10 deg would be a good range to start and more testing is needed. You might also want to make sure that it is doing the right thing.

For example, as the helicoper is moving forward while having a constant positive collective pitch, the helicopter tends to pull up. If the collective pitch is negaive, the imbalance of lift is reversed, and the heli would tend to push down. This is usually not a problem if the collective stays constant because the integral gain will compensate this constant &quot;trim&quot;. However, when changing collective while moving at a high speed (for example, fast moving side tick tocks) the heli would not move axially. It would behave in a snake shape because the I term is constantly charging and discharging in the opposite direction.  The High Speed Integral (HSI) resembles another integral term. However, its output is proportional to the collecive input, which reverses when the collective is negative. This is the &quot;arching&quot; effect you might see on FBLs like a vbar, where if one tilt the helicotper at high collective, and move the collective up and down, the swash plate would resemble one side of a seesaw.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"How to tune it?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"High Speed Integral","url":"/docs/Tuning/High-Speed-Integral#how-to-tune-it","content":" To properly tune the HSI, one has to be able to fly maneuvers comfortably at a relatively high speed. The best maneuver is the fast moving ticktocks. It is advised to start low (about 30) and see if theres snaking at the first few tick tocks. The higher O-gain you use, the faster it reacts to high speed, meaning the amount of time ticktock becomes axial is lowered. Ideally, the O-gain should be just high enough to havo no snaking. Too high might result in bobbling during stationary tick tocks because it is essentially an I gain at constant collective.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"(Advanced Topic) Tick tock Optimization​","type":1,"pageTitle":"High Speed Integral","url":"/docs/Tuning/High-Speed-Integral#advanced-topic-tick-tock-optimization","content":" The problem of naively implementing the HSI is repeated maneuvers like tick tocks. The HSI works the best when the heli needs reversed &quot;trim&quot; when collective is reversed. However, there is another scenario that this could happen: during ticktocks. Assume there's some error that reverses at each stops of the ticktocks, then the HSI would tend to charge up little by little at each end, resuling unwanted bobbling right after each collective change.  Currently, there seems to be three ways to solve this problem. The simplest way is to not deal with the problem at all and use a very fast I-term decay on the normal integral gain to &quot;soothe&quot; the effect. However, the fast I-term decay creates significant drifting problem in other scenarios, making the heli less predictable.  A much more sophisicated way to deal with this issue. From behavior of the pilots, we know that when the cyclic inputs are high, theres a very low chance that the heli would keep the same airspeed at the input direction. Therefore, the HSI would be added to the normal I term (in the input direction) at some cyclic threshold. This preserves the HSI in the orthogonal direction but &quot;deletes&quot; them in the parallel direction.  RF2 follows the previous logic. However, instead of &quot;deleting&quot; the HSI, it &quot;decays&quot; HSI in a set speed (dictated by the offset_bleed_rate_curve and offset_bleed_limit_curve parameter) into the normal-I. Therefore, a extremely fast impulse on the stick would not result in a complete deletion of the HSI.

One way to solve this problem is to lower the HSI charging rate at high collective (offset_charge_curve). It effectly lowers the equivalent I-gain at high collective which helps maintain the PID balance. However, the adverse effect is that this assumes no significant airspeed change when collective is high, which in some extreme cases might not be true. Also, snaking migh occur if one prefer to use high collective during fast moving ticktocks. Therefore, it is advised to have the charge rate as high as possible at high collective to minimize the effect.

A motorised tail can provide high control authority in one direction. In the other it is greatly reduced as the motor can only turn in one direction. TTA is ised to add control authority in the other direction. It does this by rapidly accelerating the main motor. This acceleration provides torque in the oposite direction to the tail motor. Tuning TTA is best performed by pushing your heli into a flight envelope in which you loose tail authority. A simple flight pattern is to fly backawards as fast as possible.. with the tail going into the wind. If you notice the heli suddently doing a sharp rotation.. sometimes up to 180 degrees; then your TTA needs to be higher. Simply raise the value in increments of 10 until the problem starts to go away. Sometimes you will find that your heli will be find with flying backwards; but flip out in agressive manouvers. For example a 'tail slide' or 'backwards loop' will trigger it. As above.. raise the gain until the issue is largely mitigated. Note. Its possible you will never 100% clear the swing that can occur. The original 'OMP M2' for example will still show the issue at times with even the maximum TTA gain.

If you do not have filters enabled it is particularly important that you do not use Derivative. This can result in hot Motors and Servos.  note What do we mean &quot;wobble&quot;?? When tuning parameters are too high the helicopter will wobble or shake during some movements. Each time we increase a tuning value we need to test fly and see if the new setting is too high. Test this in the following way: Beginner: Tap the stick and see if it shakes/shudders/wobblesAverage: Do some flips with sudden stops, try going fast and tapping the stick, do some TictocsAdvanced: Do crazy high speed high rate stuff that makes the FC sweat and see if it freaks out 😜. Please also see the General Guidlines below for more specific descriptions​  Increase Derivative (D) on each axis individually, (roll, pitch, yaw) until it wobbles, then back off a bit. (remember!! don't do this if your filters are not working). Increase Proportional (P) on each axis individually, until it wobbles, then back off a bit. Increase Integral (I) on each axis individually, until it wobbles, then back off a bit. Set Feedforward so that you get good response and Integral (I) remains near 0 in full stick flips and rolls (viewed using the blackbox logs). Feedforward can also be tuned by following the desctiption in Tune Feedforward. If necessary, then tweak P:D ratio to tweak stick response damping to your liking. Increase HSI until it wobbles when jabbing elevator at full collective, back off a bit.    Increase Boost (B) if you want sharper/faster response.

It is advised to start here.The roll axis is the easiest. Many different gains works on the roll axis. It is advised to tune last.D-gain dampens oscillations caused by P, P-gain dampens oscillations caused by I.I-oscillation are very slow (0.5-1Hz) while P and D oscillations are fast (5-8Hz).If there is I-oscillation, one could lower the I-gain or raise the P-gain.The best maneuver to see I-oscillation is to pirouetting long pitch pumps. If the heli does not stop clean and has a large shake, it is either I-gain being too high or P-gain being too low.It is possible to use the same I-gain on pitch and roll axis.Check tick-tock stops to see if P and D are too high by observing the fast oscillations. If oscillations are mainly slow, I-gain might be too high.The B-gain should be increased incrementally to fit how sharp the response you want. Usually only pitch needs a significant B-gain.Too high on B-gain results in unwanted oscillations at stops if low B-gain did not cause it.One could also experiment the I-relax to tune out the I-oscillations at stops. Lower number means stronger relax. Notice that a extremely low number might make the helicopter feel unpredictable. low number also hide gain imbalance that could show up during high-demand maneuvers or natural occuring disturbances (like a gust of wind) ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Backup and restore","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/Tutorial-Setup/Backup-and-restore","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Back up the configuration​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Backup and restore","url":"/docs/Tutorial-Setup/Backup-and-restore#back-up-the-configuration","content":" Backups of your Rotorflight configuration can be taken in order to restore a controller to a previous state, in the event of a failure, or to duplicate your controller to use on another helicopter.

It accepts data in the form of 8 bits each of Red-Green-Blue.  The WS2812 is integrated into the package of a 50:50 LED rather than as a separate device. It accepts data in the form of 8 bits each of Green-Red-Blue.  With the SK6812 also GRBW variants are supported, which have a fourth (white) channel and such provide a much cleaner white color.  It is thus possible, depending on the LED board/strip being used that either Red-Green-Blue or Green-Red-Blue encoding may be required. This may be controlled by setting the following.  set ledstrip_grb_rgb = RGB   or  set ledstrip_grb_rgb = GRB   or  set ledstrip_grb_rgb = GRBW   Then confirm the required setting by simply setting an LED to be green. If it lights up red, you have the wrong setting. Afterwards check if the second LED also lights up red - if not, you might have 4-color SK6812 LEDs and would have to select GRBW.  Combining RGB and GBR(W) LEDs​  If you're using both WS2811 and WS2812/SK6812 LEDs, set ledstrip_grb_rgb to GRB or GRBW. The colors of the WS2811 LEDs will then be incorrect. To correct this, indicate which LEDs use RGB by specifying those LEDs in ledstrip_inverted_format - a 32 bit bitmask.

WS2812 LEDs on full brightness can consume quite a bit of current. It is recommended to verify the current draw and ensure your supply can cope with the load. It's also possible to power one half of the LEDs from one BEC and the other half from another BEC. Just ensure that the GROUND is the same for all BEC outputs and LEDs.  LED Strip pin should be:  on a separate timerwith DMA enabled  If you have LEDs that are intermittent, flicker or show the wrong colors then drop the VIN to less than 4.7v, e.g. by using an inline diode on the VIN to the LED strip. The problem occurs because of the difference in voltage between the data signal and the power signal. The WS2811 LED's require the data signal (Din) to be between 0.3 * Vin (Max) and 0.7 * VIN (Min) to register valid logic low/high signals. The LED pin on the CPU will always be between 0v to ~3.3v, so the Vin should be 4.7v (3.3v / 0.7 = 4.71v). Some LEDs are more tolerant of this than others.

Configure the LEDs using the led command.  The led command takes either zero or two arguments - an zero-based LED number and a sequence which indicates pair of coordinates, direction flags and mode flags and a color.  If used with zero arguments it prints out the LED configuration which can be copied for future reference.  Each LED is configured using the following template: x,y:direction:mode:color:blinkpattern:blinkpause:alternatecolor  x and y are grid coordinates of a 0 based 16x16 grid, north west is 0,0, south east is 15,15direction specifies the directions, since an LED can face in any direction it can have multiple directions. Directions are:  N - NorthE - EastS - SouthW - WestU - UpD - Down  For instance, an LED that faces South-east at a 45 degree downwards angle could be configured as SED.  Note: It is perfectly possible to configure an LED to have all directions NESWUD but probably doesn't make sense.  mode specifies the modes that should be applied an LED. A mode consists of a base function and zero or more overlays.

This color has a black border in the Configurator.  blinkpattern specifies a 16 bit bitmask which indicates when a LED should blink. Example: two fast blinks would be 5 (binary 101), two slow blinks 3855 (binary 111100001111). The alternatecolor is used for blinking.  blinkpause specifies whether blinking should pause after the blink pattern has been finished. A value of 0 doesn't pause blinking, a value of 3 pauses the blinking for three subsequent rounds.  alternatecolor specifies the color for: a. blinking; b. fading between color and alternatecolor if the LED profile is switched from STATUS to STATUS_ALT. The alternatecolor can be black if you want to turn a light off in in the STATUS_ALT profile. The alternate color has a red border in the Configurator.

Blink​  This overlay makes the LED blink from the current active color to the alternate color. You can set the blink rate using ledstrip_blink_period_ms.  Flicker​  This overlay makes the LED flicker, a bit like a candle. Set the flicker rate using ledstrip_flicker_rate.  Fade to alt color​  A LED with this overlay will fade to the alternate color in the profile STATUS_ALT. Specify Black as the alternate color to turn LEDs off (e.g. for switching off landing lights). You can set the fade rate with ledstrip_fade_rate.  Larson Scanner (Cylon Effect)​  The Larson Scanner replicates the scanning &quot;eye&quot; effect seen on the mechanical Cylons and on Kitt from Knight Rider. This overlay dims all of the LEDs it is assigned to and brightens certain ones at certain times in accordance with the animation. The animation is active regardless of arm state.  VTX Frequency​  This overlay makes the LED color dependent on the current channel of the VTX, in case it is equipped with SmartAudio or IRC Tramp. The color is selected according to the following table:  Frequency range\tDefault color\tColor index&lt; = 5672\tWhite\t1 &gt; 5672 &lt; = 5711\tRed\t2 &gt; 5711 &lt; = 5750\tOrange\t3 &gt; 5750 &lt; = 5789\tYellow\t4 &gt; 5789 &lt; = 5829\tGreen\t6 &gt; 5829 &lt; = 5867\tBlue\t10 &gt; 5867 &lt; = 5906\tDark violet\t11 &gt; 5906\tDeep pink\t13  The default color can be changed by double-clicking the color and moving the Hue slider or by using the color command in the CLI.

If arming is disabled the LED will be set to the background color, which usually is black.  Note: Armed State cannot be used with Flight Mode.  Thrust state​  This mode fades the current LED color to the previous/next color in the HSB color space depending on throttle stick position. When the throttle is in the middle position the color is unaffected, thus it can be mixed with orientation colors to indicate orientation and throttle at the same time. Thrust should normally be combined with Color or Mode/Orientation.  Thrust ring state​  This mode is allows you to use one or multiple LED rings (e.g. NeoPixel ring) for an afterburner effect. LEDs with this mode will light up with their assigned color in a repeating sequence. Assigning the color black to an LED with the ring mode will prevent the LED from lighting up.  A better effect is achieved when LEDs configured for thrust ring have no other functions.  LED direction and X/Y positions are irrelevant for thrust ring LED state. The order of the LEDs that have the state determines how the LED behaves, and the throttle value determines the animation rate. The animation is only active while armed.  Each LED of the ring can be a different color. The color can be selected between the 16 colors available.  For example, LED 0 is set as a Ring thrust state LED in color 13 as follow.  led 0 2,2::R:13   LED strips and rings can be combined.  Solid Color​  The mode allows you to set an LED to be permanently on and set to a specific color.  x,y position and directions are ignored when using this mode.  Other modes will override or combine with the color mode.  For example, to set LED 0 to always use color 10 you would issue this command.  led 0 0,0::C:10   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Colors​","type":1,"pageTitle":"LED Strip","url":"/docs/Tutorial-Setup/LED-Strip#colors","content":" Colors can be configured using the cli color command.

The RPM filters require real time motor speed information to be available to the flight controller. This can be obtained with a Frequency Sensor or by using Bidirectional DSHOT.  Once the FC knows the motor speed, it can calculate the main and tail rotor speeds. For this it needs to know the Main Rotor Gear Ratio and the Tail Rotor Gear Ratio, which you can specify in the Motors tab.

This will be 1500 or 1520 depending on your radio.  Stability modes will try to stabilize to the calibrated flight controller level. This is rarely perfectly aligned with the actual helicopters attitude where there is no drift (least drift... there will always be some due to wind etc). In order to calibrate this in-flight we have 2 methods:  Using the Rotorflight Lua ScriptsStick controls  Note that it's also possible to adjust accelerometer trim values in the Configuration tab of the Configurator.  Calibration using Lua Scripts​  Select Accelerometer Trims from the Rotorflight main menu. Test fly the heli tail-in in either Angle or Horizon mode, with sticks at centre. If the heli drifts left, increase roll trim. If it drifts backwards, increase pitch trim. Each time you make a change to the trims long press the wheel/roller. The Page menu should now pop up. Select Save page. Adjust trims until the heli flies hands off without any pronounced drift in any direction.    Calibration using Stick Commands​  Standard 'Betaflight' stick commands work with Rotorflight. The accelerometer trims can be calibrated using these commands.
