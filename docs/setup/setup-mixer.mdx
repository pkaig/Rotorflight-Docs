# Mixer Setup and Calibration
:::caution 
Before starting on this step the Servos should already be connected and calibrated.  
:::

## Set mixer type
* Choose the **Swashplate type** to suit your helicopter swash arrangement.   
* Choose the **Main rotor direction**. Generally this is clockwise however some scale helicopters are anticlockwise. 
* Check **Control directions**. With the transmitter on and servos powered.  
    * Command a roll to the right on the Tx. Check the swash rolls right. Reverse direction is required.  
    * Command the elevator to pitch forward on the Tx. Check the swash pitches forward. Reverse direction is required.  
    * Increase collective on the Tx. Check collective angle also increases. Reverse direction is required.

## Calibrating The mixer
:::info note
The purpose of the mixer calibration is to set the helicopters physical blade angle to the angle commanded by the FC
:::
### Mixer override
Set the mixer override at the bottom of the pages to **ON**. This will open the override window.

![Mixer Tab](../configurator/img/mixer-override.png)

### Level the swashplate and blade pitch to zero
* With the Mixer override enabled and all set to 0 degrees as above (servo arms should be at 90 deg).
* Trim the swashplate to level using the ball links.  
:::info note
If the link arms are **not adjustable** then use the **Roll trim** and **Pitch trim** as required.
:::
* Adjust the upper link arms to zero the blade pitch. If the link arms are not adjustable use the **Collective trim** to zero.

### Collective Calibration
* Confirm with a blade pitch tool that with collective mixer at 0 deg the blades are also at 0 deg.  
* Set the collective mixer override to 9 deg. Measure the blade angle.   
* If the Blade angle is different from the Override angle, increase or decrease [**Collective Calibration %**](../configurator/tabs/mixer.md#cyclic-and-collective-calibration) until the bade angle matches.  
* Set collective back to 0 deg.

### Cyclic Calibration
* Set the pitch override to 9 deg.  
* Measure the blade pitch  
* Increase or decrease the [**Cyclic Calibration %**](../configurator/tabs/mixer.md#cyclic-and-collective-calibration)

### Variable Pitch Yaw Calibration
* Set YAW override to 0 deg.
* Adjust the push rod length so that the rear tail L arm is 90°.
* If this does not give 0° blade pitch, adjust Center trim until you have 0° blade pitch.
* Set mixer yaw override to 22deg CW/CCW, adjust [**Yaw Calibration %**](../configurator/tabs/mixer.md#tail-rotor-settings) until you have around 45deg both ways.  
**Note** 22 is close enough to 1/2 of 45 deg.
* Set mixer yaw override to 60deg CW/CCW, adjust [**CW / CCW blade angle limits**](../configurator/tabs/mixer.md#tail-rotor-settings) to the maximum number that does not causing binding.

:::info note
* The calibration and CW / CCW limits vs. blade pitch is never perfect, because of the geometry asymmetry. It does not matter.
* The reason for doing the calibration is to make the PID defaults better. Without the calibration, all defaults in PID Profile are probably wrong.
* The Centre trim is mostly needed for making the CW/CCW blade angle limit numbers to match the blade angles. It also helps the feedforwards to work correctly.
