This is probably the easiest and most straightforward way to make changes. At the bottom of each page there is an **Edit this page** button. Click on this link to take you to the project folder on Github.

## Adding a new page
Download one of the current pages. Open the Markdown (.MD) file in an Editor. At the top of the file change the **Sidebar_Position** to position your new page where you wish it to be in the sidebar. The current pages are numbered with a spacing of 10 so there are free spaces for new pages between each. 

Once complete **add File** and upload the new page.
