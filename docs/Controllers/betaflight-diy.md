# Diy board - Betaflight FC

Rotorflight is a fork of the popular Betaflight project commonly used for drones. This means that all of the drone boards designed for betaflight are also compatible with Rotorflight. Drones most commonly use 4 motors and do not have servos so we need to do some additional configuration to add these items (as shown below).
