# Arming 

**Arming** is a safety feature that checks a series of settings in the FC to make sure it is safe before allowing it to spool up. It checks for things like accelerometer calibration, gyro filtering, throttle not at minimum, RX not connected.  

* Arming should be on a separate switch and preferably one that is not easy to get to and switch by accident. Flick this switch to Arm the Flight controller, then once successful you turn off throttle hold (on an easy to get to switch so you can hold quickly if you need to) and let it spool up.
* Arm is entwined in a lot of the Rotorflight code (from the betaflight base). Lots of components are disabled while it is not armed. As a result if you disable in flight you are probably going to crash. 2 switches is the key.

The latest v2.1 when you Arm successfully the swashplate will do a wiggle to indicate everything is ok.

**Arming is different to throttle hold**. Throttle hold is just a switch that sets the throttle signal to minimum. It is only on the Transmitter and not on the Flight Controller. 

## Transmitter configuration
The transmitter simply needs a channel that switches between Low (disarmed) and High (Armed). This can be any switch; however, it is preferable that it is not easy to accidentally switch in flight. 

:::caution ELRS Arming Channel 
    For ELRS receivers - Put your arm switch on AUX1, and set it as 1000 is disarmed, 2000 is armed.  

    Please read [ELRS switch configs and Arming](https://www.expresslrs.org/software/switch-config/#why-do-you-keep-saying-put-arm-on-aux1) for more details  
:::

For EdgeTx this would look like this: 

![Arming](./img/arming-1.png)

This simply switches the Arm channel (CH5/Aux1) from 0% (1000us) to 100% (2000us).

      />

## Flight Controller configuration
As shown in the video below:  
**1.** Open the [Modes tab](../Configurator/Modes.md)  
**2.** Set the channel to match your switch (in this case AUX1)  
**3.** Drag the sliders to the top end of the channel  
**4.** Save  
**5.** Toggle the chanel and watch the red indicator pip move. When it is inside the upper range the ARM box turns red.  
**Note** **-** The box shows as **"(Disabled)"** because it is connected to the Configurator.

## Swashplate Wiggle indication
The swashplate is configured to indicated successful Arming as well as Errors. More details can be found on the [Swashplate wiggle](../Tutorial-Setup/Swash-wiggle.mdx) page.

## Arming Disable flags
The Arming disable flags are a list of issues that could be preventing your helicopter from Arming. These are things like Gyro not configured, Receiver fail ot throttle not at minimum. Please see the list below for details of each flag and how to fix it.   

There are several ways to identify what is preventing your helicopter from Arming. You can view the Arming disable flags from the configurator or on the transmitter (if you have a transmitter with Rotorflight Lua scripts).

<Tabs groupId="Enable-flags">
  <TabItem value="Configurator" label="Configurator">
    ### Configurator
    The Arming disable flags are displayed on the Status tab. Disable flag **MSP** means you are connected to the configurator.   

    ![Arming](./img/arming-4.png)

    You can enable arming while connected to the configurator by the selecting the **enable arming** toggle.  
    **WARNING** this should only be done with blades off!!
