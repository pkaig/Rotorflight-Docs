# Introduction  
Rotorflight is a flight control software suite for single rotor RC helicopters. It is based on Betaflight, with many advanced features added for helicopters. It consists of several components:

* The Rotorflight Configurator: update and configure the firmware using Windows, macOS or Linux.
* Rotorflight Firmware: the software that runs on your flight controller (loaded via the configurator).
* Rotorflight Blackbox Explorer: analyse Rotorflight logs on your computer.
* Rotorflight LUA scripts: tweak your helicopter on the field using your OpenTX/EdgeTX transmitter.

Rotorflight does NOT support multi-rotor drones, nor airplanes; it is only for traditional RC helicopters.

Most Betaflight F4, F7 and H7 flight controllers are compatible with Rotorflight. They usually require some soldering. 

Since 2023 there are also commercial [**Rotorflight controllers**](../Wiki/Controllers/intro.md) available, such as the 
* [**Flywing HELI-F405**](./Controllers/flywingf405heli.md)  
* [**FlyDragon F722 v2.2**](./Controllers/flydragon2.2.md)  
* [**Radiomaster Nexus**](./Controllers/rm-nexus.md)  
* [**Matek G474Heli**](./Controllers/matek_heli.md)  
* [**Matek G474H-lite**](./Controllers/matek_hlite.md)
